## üìä **Data Requirements**

### **Expected Dataset Format**
- **File**: `fpl-data-stats.csv`
- **Structure**: Gameweek-by-gameweek player records
- **Key Columns**: 
  - `web_name` (Player name)
  - `team_name` (Team name)
  - `element_type` (Position: 1=GK, 2=DEF, 3=MID, 4=FWD)
  - `gameweek` (Gameweek number)
  - `total_points`, `minutes`, `now_cost`, `selected_by_percent`
  - `G`, `A`, `xG`, `xA` (Goals, Assists, Expected Goals, Expected Assists)
  - `CS`, `xCS`, `GC`, `xGC` (Clean Sheets, Expected Clean Sheets, Goals Conceded, Expected Goals Conceded)
  - `shots`, `SoT`, `key_passes` (Shots, Shots on Target, Key Passes)

### **Data Coverage**
- **Players**: 700+ active FPL players
- **Teams**: All 20 Premier League teams
- **Timeframe**: Complete gameweek data (typically covers 6+ gameweeks)
- **Quality**: No missing values in critical columns

---

## üîß **Core Components**

### **1. Data Processing Engine**
- **Gameweek Aggregation**: Converts individual gameweek records to season totals
- **Data Validation**: Handles missing values and data quality issues
- **Performance Metrics**: Calculates per-game averages and efficiency ratios

### **2. Team Strength Analysis**
- **Attack Strength**: Based on xG (40%), Goals (30%), Shots (30%)
- **Defense Strength**: Based on Clean Sheet Rate (40%), Inverse Goals Conceded (60%)
- **Rankings**: All 20 teams ranked from #1 (best) to #20 (worst)

### **3. Fixture Difficulty System**
- **Rank-Based Logic**: Compares team attack rank vs opponent defense rank
- **Home Advantage**: +1 rank improvement for home teams
- **Difficulty Scale**: Very Easy ‚Üí Easy ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Hard ‚Üí Very Hard
- **Favorability Score**: -10 to +10 scale for quantitative comparison

### **4. Player Analysis Tools**
- **Top Performers**: Season leaders by total points and per-game averages
- **Value Analysis**: Points per million ¬£ calculations
- **Hidden Gems**: Low ownership players with strong underlying metrics
- **Position-Specific Rankings**: Optimized scoring for GK/DEF/MID/FWD

## üìñ **Usage Guide**

### **Basic Workflow**
1. **Run Data Loading** (Cells 1-3): Import and explore dataset
2. **Process Season Stats** (Cell 14): Aggregate gameweek data
3. **Generate Team Rankings** (Cell 19): Create strength rankings
4. **Analyze Fixtures** (Cell 20): Input your fixtures and get recommendations
5. **Review Player Recommendations** (Cell 21): Find best picks by position


### **Interpreting Results**
- **üî• Strong Pick**: Favorability score > 3.0
- **‚≠ê Good Pick**: Favorability score 1.5-3.0  
- **Average**: Favorability score 0-1.5
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid**: Favorability score -1.5-0
- **‚ùå Strong Avoid**: Favorability score < -1.5

## üßÆ **Analysis Methodology**

### **Team Strength Calculation**
```python
# Attack Strength Formula
attack_strength = (xG_per_game * 0.4) + (goals_per_game * 0.3) + (shots_per_game * 0.3)

# Defense Strength Formula  
defense_strength = (clean_sheet_rate * 0.4) + (1/(goals_conceded_per_game + 0.1) * 0.6)
```

### **Fixture Difficulty Logic**
```python
# For Attacking Players
rank_difference = away_defense_rank - home_attack_rank
favorability_score = rank_difference / total_teams * 10

# Example: Arsenal ATT#1 vs Brighton DEF#12
# rank_difference = 12 - 1 = 11 (very favorable)
# favorability_score = 11/20 * 10 = +5.5 (Strong Pick)
```

### **Statistical Approach**
- **Expected Stats Priority**: xG and xA weighted heavily for sustainability
- **Volume Metrics**: Shots and key passes indicate involvement
- **Efficiency Ratios**: Points per game and points per million for value
- **Consistency Factors**: Minutes played and games started
