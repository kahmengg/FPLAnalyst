    "### 🌐 **Web Interface Development**\n",
    "To create a beautiful web interface for better visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Copy the Tempo.new prompt** from `tempo_prompt.md` in your folder\n",
    "2. **Paste it into [Tempo.new](https://tempo.new)** to generate the web interface\n",
    "3. **The web version will include:**\n",
    "   - Interactive fixture difficulty heatmaps\n",
    "   - Visual team strength comparisons  \n",
    "   - Drag-and-drop transfer planning tools\n",
    "   - Real-time gameweek analysis\n",
    "   - Mobile-responsive design\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **Advanced Features to Add**\n",
    "- **Fixture Run Analysis**: Analyze 3-5 fixture sequences for transfer timing\n",
    "- **Captain Recommendations**: Find best captaincy options by gameweek\n",
    "- **Differential Picks**: Identify low-owned players with good fixtures\n",
